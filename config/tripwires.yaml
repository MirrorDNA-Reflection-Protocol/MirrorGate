# MirrorGate Tripwire Configuration
# ⟡ Behavioral pattern detection thresholds
#
# Tripwire types:
#   drift: Compare behavior to baseline
#   autonomy_creep: Self-initiated action ratio
#   scope_expansion: New areas accessed without prompt
#   confidence_collapse: Low-confidence streaks
#   loop_detection: Repeated similar actions
#
# Responses:
#   alert: Log and notify
#   log: Log only
#   escalate: Require Paul's attention
#   soft_block: Block with option to override
#   pause: Pause and reflect
#   interrupt: Stop immediately
